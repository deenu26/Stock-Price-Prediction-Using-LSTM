","If anything, MedMen, on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, Calif., looks just like an Apple Store. It’s decked out with blond wood tables on which a range of products are artfully displayed — the Puffco Peak portable vaporizer, an electronic Dosist vape pen, the latest issue of Ember magazine and, of course, so much weed delivered in an astonishing variety of ways, from tinctures to gummy bears to cookies to just plain joints. A crowd of customers is attended to by cheerful staff members decked out in jaunty red hoodies and carrying iPads. “Let’s be buds” urges a sign on one table.","We need the next wave of innovation, and we need it now.

","The photographer William Mullan estimates that his obsession with apples began when he was a high schooler in Esher, a small town outside of London. An Egremont apple caught his eye at the local Waitrose, a British chain of upscale grocery stores. “I was really curious as to why such a highly selective supermarket would carry an apple that most people would agree looks like a potato and not at all what we demand an apple look like as consumers,” he recalls. But when he tried it, the apple was, in his words, mind-blowing. “It’s a really delicious, complex apple that has all these wonderfully nutty and cidery notes — like chestnuts and hot apple cider,” he says. “It tastes like the Instagram filter you’d pick for a photo of autumn leaves.” From then on, he was hooked, spending hours, and eventually years, researching apple varieties and the history of the fruit.","In “Odd Apples,” William Mullan chronicles — and idealizes — rare varieties of the fruit.

These were places that served what was then referred to as Continental cuisine, their menus drawn from those of Spain, Italy, France and the United Kingdom and filtered through an American sensibility. Now, Keller is returning to the comfort food of his youth with TAK Room, opening in Manhattan’s new Hudson Yards complex later this month. The 180-seat, two-story space (with a wraparound gold-leafed Cubist-style mural on the ground floor and a grand polished walnut staircase leading to the second) will offer clams casino, oysters Rockefeller and cornflake-crusted crab cake served with coleslaw and spicy mayonnaise as well as classic mains such as roasted chicken for two, Dover sole in brown butter and parsley-topped strip steak. These dishes might be paired with an expertly mixed Rob Roy or Tom Collins and, for dessert, there’s spumoni and ice cream sundaes. “I’m not trying to invent anything,” says Keller. But he is trying to build a New York restaurant more approachable than Per Se, his celebrated fine-dining outfit farther uptown. “It used to be that you ate out to meet friends and to celebrate,” he says. “There was a real sense of fun.” To that end, TAK Room diners can look forward to live music and table-side preparations, which, Keller believes, aren’t about showing off technique so much as personality. — MAYUKH SEN","T’s roundup of people, places and things to know now.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/t-magazine/thomas-keller-tak-room-paul-smith-toys-fashion-news.html

As far as adherence to reality goes, Martin Scorsese’s new “Bob Dylan story” sits somewhere between Scorsese’s 2005 Dylan documentary, “No Direction Home,” and “Solo: A Star Wars Story.” In other words: It’s loose with the facts. There’s tour footage shot in 1975 and more recent on-camera interviews with Dylan, Joan Baez, Sam Shepard and other real figures — the kind of things you’d expect. But there are also some fictional characters mixed in, like a fake filmmaker (played by Martin von Haselberg) who we are told shot the tour footage. (In reality, the footage was shot for Dylan’s much-maligned 1978 film, “Renaldo and Clara.”) This coloring outside the lines of traditional documentary is fitting for a movie about Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Revue, a hectic parade through the northeastern United States and Canada that saw Dylan performing in offbeat venues like a mah-jongg parlor in Falmouth, Mass., with a band that included Baez, T Bone Burnett and, eventually, Joni Mitchell.","Martin Scorsese’s new Bob Dylan documentary debuts on Netflix.

2019-12-22T00:00:00+0000,Whole Roast Suckling Pig,,"A whole roast suckling pig is quite special. No other feast food of the holiday season cooks so easily, and presents so majestically. With its mahogany, crisp skin and its sticky-tender meat, people thrill to be at the party where this is on the buffet. Measure your oven, and be firm with your butcher about the pig’s size, so you can be sure it will fit — most home ovens can easily accommodate a 20-pounder. Then, just give the pig the time it needs in a low and slow oven for its meat to reach its signature tender, succulent perfection, while you clean the house or do whatever it is you do before a special party. For the last 30 minutes, ramp the heat of the oven all the way up to get that insanely delicious crackling skin.",,,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020720-whole-roast-suckling-pig

2019-12-27T20:57:14+0000,Stocks Are on the Verge of the Best Year Since 1997,Three Federal Reserve rate cuts and a rally in huge tech stocks like Apple have helped lift the S&P 500 by 29 percent so far in 2019.,"The world is enmeshed in a trade war. The president has been impeached. The tech industry is under attack from regulators worldwide. But this year investors said: So what? The stock market is closing in on its best year in two decades. With only two days of trading to go, the S&P 500 could fare better than it has since 1997. Stock prices have been buoyed by a mere whiff of optimism that the economy — despite occasional hiccups and dire prognostications by so-called experts — will keep chugging along. And the Federal Reserve deserves credit, too, for cutting interest rates despite scowls from a White House that wanted more. So far this year, the S&P is up 29 percent. But the market crept up gradually as investors felt their way through the turbulent year, interrupted only by a handful of short-lived retreats. Since mid-October, stocks haven’t had a single daily gain of more than 1 percent. Even on Friday, the increase was tiny, but it left the index at a record and capped a fifth consecutive week of gains.",Three Federal Reserve rate cuts and a rally in huge tech stocks like Apple have helped lift the S&P 500 by 29 percent so far in 2019.,The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/27/business/stock-market-best-year.html
