At Circus, the palm-size pies are pentagonal. The dough is lifted up around the apples, pinched and pressed into shape. To learn to make the pastry at home, I watched Circus’s bakers at work.

Garrett (Mackie), an African-American entrepreneur who moves to Los Angeles along with his wife, Eunice (Nia Long). There, Bernard meets Joe Morris (Jackson), a club owner with whom he teams up on an admirable scheme: Buying homes in white areas and renting them out to members of the city’s black middle class. They do that with the help of a somewhat guileless white colleague (played by Nicholas Hoult). The characters are based on real people. “It’s hard not to root for them even if they’re obvious and underdeveloped, burdened with dialogue that too often sounds programmatic rather than embodied,” Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times.

The original was created in the early 1900s by Maximilian Bircher-Benner, a Swiss doctor. It consisted of oats, grated apple, nuts, lemon and condensed milk and honey, but over time, people have gotten creative with the formula. This version is a choose-your-own-adventure recipe that is great to make ahead in large or small batches. Some recipes call for apple juice or applesauce for moisture, but this version uses creamy Greek yogurt instead. Tahini adds richness, but substitute another nut butter or skip it all together if you’d rather. Swap out the nuts and dried fruit to suit your tastes and what you have. (Dates are especially nice.) Thin individual servings with more milk, if needed, then top with additional fresh fruit, nuts and a drizzle of maple syrup.

Summer adds corn, tomatoes and zucchini; fall offers squash and apples; and in winter there are roots and cabbage. Meats, mainly pork, show up from time to time, and desserts amount mostly to pies, crisps and crumbles. Some ingredients are not listed in order of use, but the recipes work, though the cacio e pepe with greens is better if the greens are chopped first.

Aldous Huxley’s 1932 dystopian novel, “Brave New World,” has been ripped from the hands of your high school English teacher and thrown onscreen with this new TV adaptation. One of the highest-profile titles from NBCUniversal’s new streaming service, Peacock, the show brings to life the futuristic New London, a city where crime and disease are in the past, and residents spend their time popping happy pills and having orgies. At the story’s center are Bernard (Harry Lloyd) and Lenina (Jessica Brown Findlay), two New Londoners who bring a pair of outsiders, played by Alden Ehrenreich and Demi Moore, into the city. While the creators of the series make an effort to cook up a version of Huxley’s vision that feels fresh to 21st-century audiences, James Poniewozik wrote in his review for The New York Times that the show ultimately “transmutes a provocative warning into a vision of a sci-fi world that feels neither brave nor new.”",An adaptation of “Brave New World” is on the new streaming service Peacock.

2020-12-28T18:51:20+0000,All Alone With a Microphone,"In 2020, pop learned how much simple physical proximity affects music, and how to cope with isolation.","The last time I applauded live music with a roomful of strangers was sometime back in February. Applauding was an unremarkable reflex: the punctuation between one song and the next, a wordless expression of approval, clearing the air for the next organized vibrations. In decades of concertgoing I had often heard applause as a distraction, just noise that interrupted the musical experience. But during these long pandemic months I’ve realized that applause is really a bond: listeners communicating with performers, listeners communicating with one another and sometimes musicians applauding what they have just done together, with the audience as both witness and co-conspirator.","In 2020, pop learned how much simple physical proximity affects music, and how to cope with isolation.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/arts/music/pop-music-pandemic-isolation.html

2020-12-29T00:00:00+0000,Mulling-Spice Cake With Cream-Cheese Frosting,,"The spices in this cake from “Live Life Deliciously” by Tara Bench (Shadow Mountain, 2020) are, indeed, those you’d use if you were mulling cider or wine. They’re the flavors of fall and winter, and especially of the holidays; that their aromas linger in the kitchen is a bonus. They’re warm and hearty enough to hold their own when blended with the cake’s apple cider and molasses (use an unsulfured brand, such as Grandma’s). The batter is very thin, but it bakes up sturdy, easy to cut and ready to be generously filled and covered with cream cheese frosting. The cake is lovely on its own, but it welcomes extras. Ms. Bench decorates hers with almond and candy Christmas trees, but a little crystallized ginger or chocolate is nice too.",,,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1021767-mulling-spice-cake-with-cream-cheese-frosting
