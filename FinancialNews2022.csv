Financial statements from Walmart and Target also stoked these anxieties last week, when the companies, both struggling to outpace rising prices, reported taking significant hits in the first three months of the year. The companies’ financials gave investors more reason to believe that the central bank may begin to pursue much larger increases to interest rates, which could tip the economy into a recession.
