To answer: Yes, back in 2000, from a food truck outside the Peking Opera School, which we were visiting in Beijing. They were delicious. I had forgotten about jianbing until very recently, as a few people in New York have started making them. Mr. Goldberg, a Chinese scholar who grew up in Spring Valley, N.Y., in Rockland County, became a professional luge racer and worked in finance before running a couple of places in Hong Kong. He decided a few years ago to do something, he said, “that would be interesting and make people happy.” He’d like to do his part to make jianbing as mainstream as ramen. At his colorful stand, cooks spread a thin film of batter made with mung bean and rice flours onto a griddle, break an egg on it, add herbs and condiments, flip it, roll it and cut it in two. He has come up with nontraditional versions with roast duck, marinated chicken or roast pork. The stand also sells smashed cucumber salad, steamed dumplings and, soon, an egg, cheese and ham breakfast “bing” and sweet dessert versions. Mr. Goldberg has also taken on a couple of partners and has plans for expansions, including a brick-and-mortar shop opening in March next to his commissary in Chelsea: Mr Bing, UrbanSpace Vanderbilt, 45th Street and Vanderbilt Avenue, mr-bing.com.","A pop-up puts down roots, McDonald’s tries a different approach, and other restaurant news.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/dining/mr-bing-restaurant-jianbing-news.html

2017-09-26T00:00:00+0000,Apple Butter,,"A great answer to that eternal question — “What do I do with all these apples?” — apple butter is a sweetened, concentrated, lightly spiced spread that’s smoother than jam and thicker than applesauce and fantastic on buttered toast, thinned with vinegar as a sauce for pork chops, or used to top breakfast treats like pancakes, waffles or biscuits. The apples here are intentionally left unpeeled and uncored to take advantage of the extra flavor in the peels and pectin-rich cores. (A pass through a food mill or sieve after cooking will pull them out.) As for the ideal apple butter apple — well, there is none. Use nearly any variety: This recipe is only improved by mixing and matching. Note, too, that this can be made on the stovetop or in the oven. The oven method may take longer, but it can be worthwhile if only to avoid the inevitable splattering of the stovetop method.",,,https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018949-apple-butter
